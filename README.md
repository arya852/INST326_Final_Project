Final Project for INST326

# Project Title: Office Hours Management System for the Instructional Team

Description

The office hour management system will assist the TAs in a fair and systematic manner.
This system will help TAs to determine the sequence in which students join the office hours. TAs
will be able to discern whether a student is attending the office hour for assistance with an
assignment or to seek clarification on the module. The system will also store the data, and
professors will have an overview of the number of students who attended a specific office hour.

To run the Program:
(run the below command in the terminal or the CMD terminal)

`python main.py`

To run the test file:
(Make sure to install pytest)

`pytest test.py`

For 'test.py', I used fixtures from the Pytest Documentation.
